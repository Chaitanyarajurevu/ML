📌 Day 5 – Completed ✅

🔹 Topics Covered
Role of data visualization in Machine Learning
Using Matplotlib for basic plots
Understanding salary distribution and trends
Identifying outliers through visual analysis
Importance of preprocessing before model training

## Tasks Completed
🔹 Task 1: Plot Relationships Between Features and Target

Plotted relationships between Years of Experience, Education Level, Job Title, and Salary.
Identified strong correlation between experience and salary and moderate impact of education level.

🔹 Task 2: Identify Outliers or Patterns

Used histogram and boxplot to analyze salary distribution.
Detected extreme salary values and observed overall data patterns without training any model.

🔹 Task 3: Finalize Features for Model Training

Removed salary outliers using the IQR method.
Selected Years of Experience, Education Level, and Job Title as input features.
Separated Salary as the target variable and prepared clean data for training.
