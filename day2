📌Day 2 - Completed✅

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing a dataset used for predicting employee salaries based on three important factors:
- Years of Experience
- Education Level
- Job Title

Dataset understanding is a critical step in Machine Learning, as the quality, features, and structure of data directly impact model performance.

##  Task 1: Dataset Collection

The dataset used in this project contains employee-related information and is designed for a **Salary Prediction** Machine Learning task.

### Dataset Details
- Dataset Type: Structured data
- File Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- Machine Learning Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)

### Dataset Purpose
The dataset was selected because:
- It directly matches the problem statement defined in Day 1
- It includes both numerical and categorical features
- It reflects real-world salary prediction scenarios
- It is beginner-friendly and easy to understand

##  Task 2: Features and Target Variable

After exploring the dataset, the columns were identified and categorized as follows:

### Dataset Columns

| Column Name          | Data Type    | Role    | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Years_of_Experience | Numerical   | Feature | Number of years of professional experience |
| Education_Level     | Categorical | Feature | Highest education qualification of the employee |
| Job_Title           | Categorical | Feature | Current job role/designation of the employee |
| Salary              | Numerical   | Target  | Annual salary of the employee |

---

### Features (Input Variables)

- **Years of Experience**  
  Represents the total professional experience of an employee and has a direct impact on salary growth.

- **Education Level**  
  Represents the highest educational qualification (e.g., Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).  
  This is a categorical feature and must be encoded before model training.

- **Job Title**  
  Represents the employee’s job role or position (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Manager).  
  This feature plays a significant role in determining salary and also requires encoding.

---

### Target Variable (Output)

- **Salary**  
  A continuous numerical value representing the annual salary of an employee.  
  This is the variable that the Machine Learning model learns to predict.

##  Task 3: Dataset Observations & Analysis

### Dataset Size
- The dataset is small to medium in size.
- Suitable for beginners and learning Machine Learning fundamentals.
- Allows easy experimentation without high computational cost.

### Dataset Structure
- Total Columns: 4
- Each row represents one employee record with experience, education, job role, and salary.

---

### Data Types
- **Numerical Data**
  - Years_of_Experience
  - Salary
- **Categorical Data**
  - Education_Level
  - Job_Title

---

### Possible Data Issues

- **Categorical Encoding**
  - Education_Level and Job_Title must be converted into numerical form using encoding techniques such as Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

- **Missing Values**
  - Dataset should be checked for null or missing values before training.

- **Feature Scaling**
  - Numerical features may require scaling for better model performance.

- **Limited Features**
  - Salary depends on many real-world factors (location, company, skills, industry), which are not included in this dataset.
