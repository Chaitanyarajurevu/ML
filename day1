Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
•	Understanding what Machine Learning is
•	Why Machine Learning is needed
•	Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement (overview)
•	Basic ML workflow (problem → data → model → prediction)
•	Task 1: Write a simple definition of ML in your own words
•	Task 2: Identify one real-life problem that can be solved using ML
•	Task 3: Define the problem statement, input data, and expected output for that problem

📌 Problem Statement
Predict the price of a house based on its size using Machine Learning.


📥 Input Data

The input data for this problem consists of the size of the house measured in square feet.
Example Input:
800 sq ft
1200 sq ft

📥 Expected Output

The expected output of the Machine Learning model is the predicted price of the house.
Example Output:
₹25,00,000
₹45,00,000


🔹 Workflow for House Price Prediction

1. Define the problem:
   Predict house prices using house size.
2. Collect data:
   Gather data containing house sizes and their prices.
3. Preprocess data:
   Clean the data and remove missing values.
4. Select model:
   Choose a simple regression model.
5. Train model:
   Train the model using historical data.
6. Evaluate model:
   Check accuracy using test data.
7. Make prediction:
   Predict the price of a new house.
