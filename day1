Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
•	Understanding what Machine Learning is
•	Why Machine Learning is needed
•	Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement (overview)
•	Basic ML workflow (problem → data → model → prediction)
•	Task 1: Write a simple definition of ML in your own words
•	Task 2: Identify one real-life problem that can be solved using ML
•	Task 3: Define the problem statement, input data, and expected output for that problem

📌 Problem Statement

Predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience using Machine Learning.

📥 Input Data
The input data for this problem consists of the following features related to an employee:
Years of Experience – Total number of years the employee has worked
Education Level – Highest qualification of the employee
Example Input:
Years of Experience: 1 year, Education Level: Bachelor’s
Years of Experience: 3 years, Education Level: Master’s
Years of Experience: 5 years, Education Level: PhD

📤 Expected Output
The expected output of the Machine Learning model is the predicted salary of the employee.
Example Output:
₹20,000
₹35,000
₹50,000


🔹 Workflow for Salary Prediction

Define the problem:
Predict employee salary using years of experience.
Collect data:
Gather data containing employee experience and corresponding salaries.
Preprocess data:
Clean the dataset and handle missing or inconsistent values.
Select model:
Choose a Linear Regression model.
Train model:
Train the model using historical experience–salary data.
Evaluate model:
Measure model performance using test data.
Make prediction:
Predict salary for a new employee based on experience.
