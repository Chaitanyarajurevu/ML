📌 Day 7 – Completed ✅

🛠️ Tasks Completed
🔹 Task 1: Convert Problem into a Classification Task

Converted the salary prediction problem into a binary classification problem:

High Salary (1) → Salary greater than or equal to the median salary

Low Salary (0) → Salary below the median

Created a new binary target variable High_Salary.

Ensured the dataset remained balanced between both classes.

🔹 Task 2: Train a Logistic Regression Model

Used One-Hot Encoded features from Day 6:

Years of Experience

Education Level

Job Title (encoded)

Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets using stratified sampling.

Applied StandardScaler to scale features before training.

Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.

🔹 Task 3: Evaluate and Compare Models

Evaluated the Logistic Regression model using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Achieved approximately 90% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.

Analyzed the confusion matrix and observed:

Very few false positives and false negatives

No bias toward either class

Compared Logistic Regression (classification) with Linear Regression (regression) from Day 6:

Linear Regression predicts exact salary values
