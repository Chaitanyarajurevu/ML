🛠️ Tasks Completed

🔹 Task 1: Split Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
Split the cleaned dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data using train_test_split.
Ensured no data leakage between training and testing sets.

🔹 Task 2: Train a Linear Regression Model
Applied Multiple Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
Used Years of Experience, Education Level, and One-Hot Encoded Job Title as input features.
Trained the model to learn salary patterns from the training data.

🔹 Task 3: Evaluate Model Performance
Evaluated the model using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
Achieved an R² score of approximately 0.85, indicating strong model performance.
Analyzed model coefficients to understand the contribution of each feature to salary prediction.
Visualized model performance using Actual vs Predicted Salary plots.
